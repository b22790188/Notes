## Requirement 
+ Inception (初始化)
	+ Ask a set of questions that establish
		+ Basic understanding of the problem
		+ People who want a solution
		+ the nature of the solution that is desired, and
		+ the effectiveness of preliminary(初步的) communication and collaboration between the customer and the developer

+ Elicitation (啟發式)
	+ Process of gathering requirements or information from stakeholders, users or other resources.
+ Analysis
	+ Elaboration (精緻化)
		+ Process of `refining and expanding on the requirements and design of a software system that has already been partially defined`
	+ Negotiation

+ Specificatoin
	+ In software engineering, specification refers to the `process of defining the requirements and behavior of a software system` in a clear, unambiguous, and formal manner.
	+ A written document
	+ A set of models
	+ A formal mathematical model
	+ A collection of user scenarios (use-cases)
	+ A prototype 

+ Validation - a review mechanism that looks for 
	 + ppt 5

### Requirement management
+ A set of activities that help to identify , control , and track requirement
+ Traceability table
	+ Features
	+ Source
	+ Dependency
	+ Subsystem
	+ Interface

## Eliciting Requirements
+ Requirements gathering meetings 
+ attended by both `software engineers and customers`
+ goal
	+ identify the problem
	+ propose elements of the solution
	+ negotiate different approaches and specify a preliminary set of solution requirements
+ Before meeting, each attendee is asked to write a 1 or 2-page producet request
	+ obeject
	+ service
	+ constrains
	+ performance

## Quality Function Deployment
+ A technique that translates the customers needs into technical requirements for software
	+ Normal(Essential)
	+ Expected(Desirable)
	+ Exciting(Optional)

## Elicitation Work Product

## Agile Requirement Elicitation
+ Requirements are elicited by asking stakeholders `to create user stories`, usually in the form of cards
+ Critics
	+ Lack overall business goals and nonfucntional requirements
		+ performance , security.....
	+ Fail to provide sufficient basis for system evolution

## Use-Cases
+ A collection of user scenarios that describe the thread of usage of a system
+ Each scenario is described from the point-of-view of an "actor" - a person or device that interacts with the software in some way
+ Use-Case Diagram
+ Detailed Use-Cases
	+ Use-case
	+ Primary actor
	+ Goal in context
	+ Preconditions
	+ Tirgger
	+ Scenario
	+ Expetions

## Building the Requirement Model
+ Intent of the analysis model
	+ Provide a description of the required informational, functional, and behavioral domains 
+ Elements of the analysis model
	+ Scenario-based elements
	+ Class-based elements
	+ Behavioral elements
	+ Flow-oriented elements
